Internal handbook for Coditas teams to standardize how we use Cursor across projects. Includes curated prompts, reusable skills, rules, guardrails, and workflows for day-to-day engineering.


## Contribute your Cursor workflow (via PR)
If you're using Cursor regularly (even casually), please share what's working for you especially around Cursor **Prompts**, **MCP Servers**, **Rules**, **Skills** and **background/cloud agents**. We'll synthesize submissions into org guidelines (rules, prompts, skills, checklists) over time.


## What we're looking for 
I wanted to do personal interviews of pro-cursor users but scaling this is not possible. A viable alternative is to communicate via PRs. What you can contribute towards:

### 1) Your daily workflow
- What does a typical Cursor session look like?
- When do you use Chat vs Agent-style flows?
- Any MCP servers that worked well?
- Shortcuts, prompts, habits that improve output?
- Extensions / hooks you use?
- Do you switch models deliberately, or mostly rely on Auto?
- Any settings you recommend?

### 2) Rules you've created
- Share your User/Project/Team rules (sanitized)
- For each rule: what problem it solves + "before vs after" behavior

### 3) Background / cloud agents usage
- What tasks do you delegate (refactors, tests, docs, bugfixes, migrations, research)?
- How do you scope tasks so they finish cleanly?
- How do you review results (diff checklist, tests, linters, acceptance criteria)?
- Gotchas/failures you’ve learned to avoid

### 4) Skills
- Share any Cursor Skills you’ve created or adopted
- For each skill: describe what it does, when to use it, and any best practices for adoption


## Redaction policy (required)
This repo is intended for broad internal reuse, so submissions must be sanitized.

Do **not** include any of the following:
- Client names, proprietary project names, repo URLs, ticket links
- Secrets or credentials of any kind (tokens, keys, cookies)
- Internal endpoints, IPs, hostnames, screenshots containing sensitive info
- Proprietary source code (keep examples pseudocode-level)

Do include instead:
- Generalized patterns, pseudocode, “toy” examples, and anonymized rule snippets
- Before/after behavior descriptions (what changed and why)

By opening a PR, you confirm you've reviewed and sanitized your submission.
