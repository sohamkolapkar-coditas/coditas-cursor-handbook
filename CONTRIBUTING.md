## Contributing

Contributions should be **small** and **reusable**.

## What to contribute
- **Your daily workflow**: a system you follow; prompts; shortcuts; settings; MCP servers that worked well.
- **Rules**: user/project/team rules (sanitized) and what problem they solve.
- **Background/cloud agent usage**: what you delegate, how you scope, and how you review results.
- **Skills**: reusable workflows (with clear inputs/outputs and acceptance criteria).


## Where to put things
- **Rules**: `rules/` (organized by language/framework; keep them actionable and specific).
- **Skills**: `_shared_skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` (see `_shared_skills/README.md` for the standard structure).
- If you have something novel, please mention it accordingly.

## PR checklist (minimum bar)
- **Problem statement**: what this solves and who it helps.
- **Placement**: why it's a rule vs prompt vs skill.
- **Examples**: at least one copy-pastable example or before/after description. This is not strict though. 
- **Assumptions**: OS/tooling versions or constraints.


## Review
- **All files require review** per `CODEOWNERS`.
